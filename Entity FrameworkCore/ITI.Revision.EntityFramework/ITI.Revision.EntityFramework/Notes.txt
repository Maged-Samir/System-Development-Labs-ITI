EF - Entity Framework
FE:- Default Data Access Technology for microsoft 
     ORM Object Relational Mapper 

     in EF we have two important approches 
     1- Code first here we start with models and then migrate it to make refliction with database 
     2- DataBase first here we start as traditional way with data base and erd digrams 
our objective from EF is to transform our work from Data Driven to Domain Driven 

we have 4 mapping Ways 
 1.ef Convinsion (Default)
 2.attributes (Data Anotations)
 3.Fluent API (OnModelCreating() Method)
 4.Configuration Classes 

Work flow of EF 
 1. install packages of ef Core 
 2. create DbContext Class :DbContext
 3. in DbContext i need to create two things Connection String and Declare DbSets for every model
