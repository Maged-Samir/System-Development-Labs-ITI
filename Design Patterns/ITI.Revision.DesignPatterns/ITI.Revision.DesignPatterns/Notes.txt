Design Patterns 
Design Pattern is consider group of best solutions for common problems (specific requirments)
the concept introduced officially by Gang of 4 in 1994 , they provided us with the most important pattern 23 pattern 
can classified into three categories

  
  1. Behavioral patterns deal with communication patterns between objects
     Strategy DP
     Observer DP

  2. Structural patterns provide mechanisms to organize class and objects for larger structures
     Decorator DP

  3. Creational patterns deal with object creation in a well-defined way
  
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Strategy DP 
  if i have different strategies or different ways for a class and i need to make the object have 
  the ability to be interchangable i use this pattern 

  for implementation
  create interface for strategy as abstraction layer 
  then make different strategies implemnt this interface 
  after that inject the strategy in the ctor of object which i need to change his strategy 

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Observer DP 
  the idea of observer design pattern is the same idea of events in C# 
  i need to create notification  between objects where we have a publisher object 
  which will notify other objects with a message 

  for the implemntation 
  at first after we create  our main objects publisher and subscripers 
  i create the interface for observer 
  all work will be with subscriper
  where, we will create an array list and three methods 
  attach observers
  deattach observers 
  display observers 

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Decorator DP 
  in decrator design pattern we need to change obj to another object ( wrapper object to anoher object )

  for the implementation 
  we create interface which represent the decorator and inject the decorated object in it's ctor
