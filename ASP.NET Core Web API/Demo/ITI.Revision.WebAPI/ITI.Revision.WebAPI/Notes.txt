ASP.Net Core Web API 
API- Sharing Functionality between different Clients (Angular-React-Native JS)
Create group of End Points and make different Clients deal with them 
the same idea of MVC pattern but here we will have only models, controller 
and for the views each one will pick his view(technology)

Http Request 
              ---> 
                   Server
Http Response <---

Http Request  (Method[get-post] - Header[Metadata/json,xml,langu] -Body[data])
Http Response similler to request but we add new part Status Code(200-400-500)

RestFul APis(guidelines) - SOAP API(Old Protocol based xml)

Routing is different here not like MVC 
 [Route("api/[controller]")]
 if we have parameter changed like id
 add  [Route("{id}")]

 Don't Forget HTTP Method for every end point 

 Difference between Middleware & Filter 
 Validators attribute

 ASP.Net give us group Of Services 
 ILogger - log errors in console

 record C# class - imutable once i created object i can't change it 
 intialize it with parameter constractor 
 equality in record is value type
